Due to the completely open-source nature of Android, the exploitable vulnerability of malware

attacks is increasing. Machine learning has led to a great evolution in Android malware detection

in recent years, which is typically applied in the classifification phase. Applying neural networks

to feature selection phase is another topic worth investigating, while the correlation between fea

tures could be ignored in some traditional ranking-based feature selection algorithms. And it is

time-consuming for exploring all possible valid feature subsets when processing a large number

of Android features using a wrapper-based approach. Attempting to tackle the problem of com

putational expense and the vulnerability of the syntax integrity of multi-source data, this paper

proposed the DroidRL framework. The main idea is to apply Double DQN(DDQN) algorithm

to select a subset of features that can be effffectively used for malware classifification. To select a

better subset of features over a larger range, the exploration-exploitation policy is applied in the

model training phase.



 The RNN is used as the decision network of DDQN to give the framework

the ability to sequentially select features. Word embedding is applied for feature representation

to enhance the framework’s ability to fifind the semantic relevance of features. On one hand, The

framework’s feature selection exhibits high performance without any human intervention. On

the other hand, the proposed framework can easily be ported to other feature selection tasks with

some minor changes. The experiment results compared with difffferent classififiers, decision net

works, and related work showed a signifificant effffect using the Random Forest classififier, reaching

95.6% accuracy with only 24 features selected.
